                She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                I said: Don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one
                Who will dance on the floor in the round?
                She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
                
                She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                Who will dance on the floor in the round
                
                People always told me: Be careful of what you do
                And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
                My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love
                And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth
                
                The Billie Jean is not my lover
                She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
                But the kid is not my son
                She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
